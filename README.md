# Lecture # 2 - Python Data Structures

## Lecture Topics

- Sequences (`list`, `tuple`, `str`)
- Sequence functions and methods
- List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions
- Sets
- Dictionaries

## Introduction

In today's lecture, we will discuss Python Data Structures such as sequences, sets, and Dictionaries. We will also practice using List Comprehensions to generate new lists from lists that we are iterating over.

## Setup

1. Make sure that your current working directory (folder) contains a `Pipfile`, then run `pipenv install` in your terminal to install `pytest` and any other required packages.
2. Now that your `pipenv` virtual environment is ready to use, enter `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment.
3. Run `pytest` from inside of the `EAST-SE-012924-Phase-3` directory (if you can see `lib`, `Pipfile`, `Pipfile.lock`, `pytest.ini`, and `README.md` in your current working directory, then you are in the correct directory) to run the tests, and begin working to pass the tests. You can also run `pytest -x` to run one test at a time.
